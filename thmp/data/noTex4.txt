If $k \to S$ is an epimorphism and $k$ is a field, then $S = k$ or $S = 0$.
Let $R \to S$ be an epimorphism of rings. Then   $\Spec(S) \to \Spec(R)$ is injective, and  for $\mathfrak q \subset S$ lying over $\mathfrak p \subset R$ we have $\kappa(\mathfrak p) = \kappa(\mathfrak q)$. 
Let $R$ be a ring. Let $M$, $N$ be $R$-modules. Let $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a set of generators of $M$. Let $\{y_j\}_{j \in J}$ be a set of generators of $N$. Let $\{m_j\}_{j \in J}$ be a family of elements of $M$ with $m_j = 0$ for all but finitely many $j$. Then $$ \sum\nolimits_{j \in J} m_j \otimes y_j = 0 \text{ in } M \otimes_R N $$ is equivalent to the following: There exist $a_{i, j} \in R$ with $a_{i, j} = 0$ for all but finitely many pairs $(i, j)$ such that $$ m_j & = \sum\nolimits_{i \in I} a_{i, j} x_i \quad\text{for all } j \in J, \\ 0 & = \sum\nolimits_{j \in J} a_{i, j} y_j \quad\text{for all } i \in I. $$

 Pure ideals are determined by their vanishing locus.  Let $R$ be a ring. If $I, J \subset R$ are pure ideals, then $V(I) = V(J)$ implies $I = J$.
Let $R$ be a ring. The rule $I \mapsto V(I)$ determines a bijection $$ \{I \subset R \text{ pure}\} \leftrightarrow \{Z \subset \Spec(R)\text{ closed and closed under generalizations}\} $$
